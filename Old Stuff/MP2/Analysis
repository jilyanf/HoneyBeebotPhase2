1. FCFS
- Not good for short processes especially if there are longer processes prior
- Better if randomized arrival time if there are both long and short processes
2. SJF 
- Works best for shorter processes 
- Longer processes will starve 
3. SRPT
- Improves waiting time for longer processes since it can pre empt the shorter ones first 
- Gives access on process depending on the burst time 
- Not really fixated on one process
- More flexible
- Will shine best if processes are arranged 
4. Priority
- Best if randomized ang processes 
5. Round Robin
- Best for when there is perfect balance in time slice and the processes  
- time slice should short enough to ensure that shorter processes complete execution quickly, reduce the waiting time of longer processes

Notes: 
- Variety
- Arrangement
